Our March AGMs this year we have yet another constitution to adopt. You can find it on the <a href="http://education.qld.gov.au/corporate/pandc/" target="_blank">Education Queensland web site</a> or directly download it <a href="http://education.qld.gov.au/corporate/pandc/docs/model-constitution.doc" target="_blank">here</a>.

On the <a href="http://www.pandcsqld.com.au/pc-resources/essential-documents/pc-model-constitution/" target="_blank">P&Cs Qld Web Site</a> they state the main differences are:
  
<span><strong>The main change to the 2016 version of the Constitution is to the agenda for the Annual General Meeting â€“ Section 17.3.9 re acceptance of memberships to the P&C, adoption of the new Constitution (if any) and acceptance of Life Memberships (if any).<b>Â In the</b><span><span><span><b> past, DET has provided a comparison document and if they do so again, weâ€™ll be sure to share it.</b></span><br /><b><br/></b><span><b>The Model Constitution is a DET directive and any updates are to bring it in line with current legislation.</b></span></span></span></strong></span>

In lieu of DET providing the comparison, I've put the details of those changes here.
  
In Red is the 2015 version, in Green is the 2016 version.
