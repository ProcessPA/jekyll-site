The words “motion” and “resolution” are often used and heard of in the meetings of the board of directors of an organization. These are annual meetings that serve as platforms in proposing actions and mounting decisions. Both terms are often used simultaneously and are sometimes used interchangeably which brings about unnecessary confusions and misunderstandings. The real deal is that these two words are completely different from each other and should not be used in place of the other. 

### Motions

**** 

Simply put, motions are proposals with the aim of making the members of the meeting deliberate on the issue at hand. Motions are proposed by directors that, more often than not, needs a “seconder” before the board can debate on the issue and consider voting for a decision. Moreover, it is not required that a motion be put down into writing, it can be done so verbally. Lastly, motions are well accepted as decisions of the board and does not reflect that of the whole organization. 

### Resolutions

**** 

A resolution, on the other hand, is a motion that has been passed by the members of the meeting of the board of directors. Technically, a motion that is passed by majority of the members present and voting becomes a resolution. It is a formal act that is implemented and is binding of the board members.

### Difference

**** 

Here are the vital differences between a motion and a resolution: 

  * A motion is a proposal from a member of the meeting whereas a resolution reflects the general opinion of the board 
      * Generally speaking, not all motions can be resolutions but all resolutions come from motions 
          * Generally speaking, a motion can be put forward verbally whereas a resolution is written down and recorded</ul>
