> **Robert’s Rules of Order,&nbsp;**is a handbook dedicated to helping people run productive and effective meetings.

#### What are the three rules?

The three rules are pretty simple to follow;

1. If the report states facts or information for the assembly, then there is no need for a motion. If a motion is to be created, it is only to accept the report, which serves as an endorsement that the assembly is now responsible for it.
