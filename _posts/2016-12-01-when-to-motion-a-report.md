Committee reports are handled differently depending on their content. Motions that relate to reports are often used indiscriminately like motions to adopt or to accept. However, that is often unnecessary.

The following are the basic guiding principles that are generally followed for reports as per Robertâ€™s Rules of Order:

1. If the report states facts or information for the assembly, then there is no need for a motion. If a motion is to be created, it is only to accept the report, which serves as an endorsement that the assembly is now responsible for it. 
2. If the report contains recommendations that are not technically motions, a motion to adopt recommendations may be passed. 
3. If the report ends with a resolution, then the reporting member should move that the resolutions be adopted.
