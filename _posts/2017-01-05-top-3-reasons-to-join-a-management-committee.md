Every incorporated association has a select group of people who are tasked to manage the organization and ensure that everything is running smoothly.

With a management committee; The main roles are:

* Managing the association’s financial affairs and maintaining its financial viability
* Ensuring the association acts in accordance with its objects or purposes, and
* Meeting all legal requirements.

Members of the management committee are either appointed or elected by the members of the organization. This usually occurs during annual general meetings as defined by the organizations constitution.

Joining the management committee is a good way to help lead the organization toward their goals.
