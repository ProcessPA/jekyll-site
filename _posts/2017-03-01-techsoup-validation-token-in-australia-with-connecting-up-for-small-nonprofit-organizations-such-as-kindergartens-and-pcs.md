If you are a Kindergarten or any Nonprofit registered with the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission (ACNC) it will just take a **couple of days** for your qualification to be completed. If you are a P&C or other small organization however, you need to provide more information which will be requested as below:

_Your organisation is close to completing the registration and qualification process. We simply require evidence of your organisation&#8217;s charitable or not for profit status._

_Currently we do not have any evidence of your organisation&#8217;s charitable or not-for-profit status because it is not reflected on the Australian Business Register_ [_http://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?SearchText=55781012322_](http://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?SearchText=55781012322)
_It is a core requirement for the program that organisations are income tax exempt, you must fill out and return to us a self-assessing review worksheet for income tax exempt not-for-profits, which can be downloaded here:_ [_http://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Income-tax-status-review-worksheet-for-self-assessing-non-profit-organisations/_](http://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Income-tax-status-review-worksheet-for-self-assessing-non-profit-organisations/)

_NB. The tax review sheet must be signed_

_1. Please also provide us with a copy of your organisation&#8217;s constitution noting its not-for-profit and/or dissolution clause. You can find out more on the ATO&#8217;s website. If you don&#8217;t have a constitution let us know and we may be able to accept other documentation._ 

_All documentation may be scanned then emailed to_ <a><em>customercare@connectingup.org</em></a> _or send a faxed copy to 08 8311 5213._

For a P&C you will find information on P&Cs Qld website in a document, **Fact Sheet: P&C Non-Profit and Charity Status**, where it states, “A P&C is considered a ‘non-profit’ organization by the Australian Taxation Office”.

The two documents you will be required to return are the [Income tax status review worksheet for self-assessing non-profit organisations](https://www.ato.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=38270) and Constitution.</li> </ol> 

## TechSoup Validation Tokens
