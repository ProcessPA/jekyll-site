Not all organisations are the same. Different not-for-profit organisations serve different community needs, therefore their management boards and type of responsibilities they undertake can vary enormously. Essentially though there are certain basic tasks most boards need to undertake if they wish to be successful. There are certain fiduciary duties that all directors must uphold.&nbsp;

The first is a duty of obedience, which requires board members to follow the law, meet tax requirements, abide by their governing bylaws and remain focused on their mission statement.

The third is a duty of care, which requires directors to only take actions that are in the company's best interest.
