By now, you probably have a pretty good understanding of what a Board is<br>and does - and if you don’t, that’s ok\! Because when it comes down to it, every<br>board or committee works a little differently. Some much more differently than<br>others. You might find that some of our advice in past articles hasn’t made sense<br>because your board doesn’t do things that way. Here’s a quick overview of all the<br>different ways a board can function so you can figure out how best to go about<br>your governance.

## Governing Board

A Governing board is one where the owner of the organisation does not sit as<br>a member. Instead, the board is staffed by people able to provide direction to the<br>owner in regards to the organisation’s best interests and future goals.

## Working Board

A Working board will simultaneously work as the board of directors and the<br>staff of the organisation. This typically only happens in small or new<br>organisations where the owners can’t afford employees. If this is you, try not to<br>neglect your governance\! It can be easy to let these important things slide.

## Advisory Board

Advisory boards work in a purely advisory role. They are similar to<br>Governance boards in that they provide advice and direction to someone who is<br>running the organisation - in this case, they work with another board (usually a<br>Managing or Working board) in handling delicate situations or areas of the<br>organisation.

## Managing or Executive Board

This is the board who runs everything - they make decisions on the<br>organisations day-to-day operations together without having a CEO. In order to<br>do this effectively, they will typically function as a group of subcommittees were<br>each committee handles a different area of the organisation.

## Cooperative Board

Another style of CEO-less board, the Cooperative board is one where all<br>members work and vote equally on all points of business. Most often found in<br>small-to-medium sized nonprofit organisations where all board members are<br>working towards a singular goal.

## Policy or Carver Board

Similar to the Advisory board, the Policy board will work more in the<br>background, while a CEO, owner, or other high-level staff member puts the<br>board’s work into practice. In this case, a Policy board works on forming<br>organisational policies, practices, and directions which guide the staff or<br>volunteers in their work.

## Cortex Board

Boards working in the Cortex model will put particular emphasis on the value<br>of the organisation to the community. In most of their decision making they will<br>include ways to give back to the community, and include this as a metric for<br>evaluating how well they’re doing as an organisation.

## Figuring Out Your Style

Here’s the secret: you don’t have to conform to any single one of these\!<br>Experiment, analyse your workflows, figure out your own style that works best for<br>you. You always have time to find your feet, and mixing and matching your<br>governing style until you find the perfect fit will only lead to a more productive<br>team in the long run. Give it a go\!
