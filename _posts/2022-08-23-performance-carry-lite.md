# Performance Improved

Performance is a crucial aspect of software, as users expect it to be fast and responsive. Unfortunately, a subset of our customers recently experienced a degraded experience with Process PA. However, I am pleased to announce that we have identified and resolved the underlying issues. As a result, our customers should now experience a fast and smooth experience when loading, navigating, and entering minutes in Process PA.

# Simplified Carry Over

The process of carrying over actions and motions from one meeting to the next has been simplified in Process PA. In the past, you were required to specify the date and time of the next meeting when finalizing the previous meeting. However, this is no longer the case. Now, when finalizing a meeting, you the actions and motions are numbered, without specifying which meeting they will be carried over to. During the preparation of your next meeting, you have the flexibility to choose which actions and motions you would like to carry over, making the process more streamlined and efficient.
