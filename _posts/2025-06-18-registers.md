Registers are essential tools for boards to manage and mitigate risks and conflicts of interest. They provide a structured way to document, track, and address potential issues that could impact the organization's governance and operations. By maintaining comprehensive registers, boards can ensure transparency, accountability, and proactive management of critical matters.

### ✨ Enhancements

#### 🏷 Registers  
Introducing the **Risk Register** and **Conflict of Interest Register**. These registers are fully configurable and are being rolled out progressively. [**Contact us**](mailto:support@processpa.com?subject=Registers%20Early%20Access%20Request) if you'd like to be added to the early access group.

#### 📌 Assign Action Items to Sub-Committee  
Sub-Committees are now a valid assignee option in the **Assigned To** field on an Action Item.
    
  At the end of a meeting, action items assigned to the sub-committee are emailed to all members of the sub-committee. The action is:
  - Copied into the sub-committee with a link to the original for later follow-up  
  - Included in the **Carry Forward** list for the sub-committee

##### 📝 Complete Action Item Link from Email  
Action items can now be completed directly via a link from the email notifying the assigned member of the action.

#### 👥 Moved and Seconded Options  
Added **Moved** and **Seconded** options to the mover and seconder fields, alongside existing member selections, for cases where explicit members do not want to be recorded.

#### 🛠 Bug Fixes

##### 🐞 Fixed: Motion Number Has Erroneous Values for Global Numbering  
Resolved an issue where motion numbers had incorrect values in global numbering.
