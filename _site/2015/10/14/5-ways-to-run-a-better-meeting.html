With Term 4 now in full swing we only have a few more meetings to finish out the year. Now is a good time to have a refresher to keep going strong and have effective meetings. So here they are, 5 ways to run a better meeting.</p>

<h2 id="1-have-a-clear-agenda">1. Have a Clear Agenda</h2>

<p>A well planned meeting is a well-run meeting. Make sure the Agenda is sent out with plenty of time for attendees to be across all that is going to happen. You want people’s input so make sure they have everything the need to contribute before the meeting. For example, if you want to pass a motion to purchase something, make sure all attachments, like quotes are sent out.</p>

<h2 id="2-stay-focused">2. Stay Focused</h2>

<p>You have an agenda. Stick to it. Have an idea of the time each agenda item should take and gently keep the meeting moving and on track. To ensure people do feel include, make sure you have given opportunity for attendees to add items to the agenda well before the meeting.</p>

<h2 id="3-make-sure-everyone-gets-their-say">3. Make Sure Everyone Gets Their Say</h2>

<p>Everyone wants to be heard. The chair of the meeting is to ensure they balance personalities. Often it just involves checking in with the introverts. Make sure you hear feedback. Do your meetings go too long or even too short? Do people feel they are able to make a contribution? If you have someone who interrupts lots give them a stopwatch to keep everyone on track <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://ppa-public-web.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/wlemoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<h2 id="4-take-action-and-follow-up">4. Take Action and Follow up</h2>

<p>The best meetings are where decisions are made. To be able to do that action items need to be done between of the meeting. Make sure any actions are clearly assigned with due date and are followed up at the next meeting.</p>

<h2 id="5-practice-makes-perfect">5. Practice Makes Perfect</h2>

<p>We get some great experience while volunteering in a P&amp;C. Over time you will get better at all of the above. Be patient with yourself and others. Remember the greater purpose of why you are running the meetings. It is a tough but very important service you are providing. Hang in there!</p>
