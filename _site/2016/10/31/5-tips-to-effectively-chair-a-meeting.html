                <p>Every group, team or organization is unique. Each may require a different approach in terms of chairing meetings. But we have outlined basic ways on how to effectively chair meetings to ensure that the best positive outcome is achieved.</p>

                <h4 id="1-set-goals">1. Set goals</h4>

                <p>Before the meeting starts it is important to determine what the goal of the meeting is. Specifically, what outcome or decisions should be agreed upon during the meeting? This can be used as metrics to measure the effectivity and efficiency of the meeting as well.</p>

                <h4 id="2-notices">2. Notices</h4>

                <p>It is important to release advance notices about relevant meeting information to members. The notice should include the following:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Agenda
                    <ul>
                      <li>Project/Agenda item head
                        <ul>
                          <li>Time of the meeting
                            <ul>
                              <li>Place of the meeting
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Relevant documents
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Minutes of the preceding meeting if applicable&lt;/ul&gt;
                                        <h4 id="3-time-management">3. Time Management</h4>
                                      </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>During the meeting, one good way to ensure that everyone stays on track is to set a time frame per agenda item. The role of the chair is to make sure that time frame is observed. If possible, put the timer on a screen for everyone to see.</p>
