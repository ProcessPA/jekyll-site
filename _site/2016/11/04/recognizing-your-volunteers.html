Volunteers are not paid to do work for organizations and getting them to stay and appreciate their contribution does not require monetary resources as well. It is essential to develop a continuous process to thank and recognize the efforts of your volunteers to help them stay fulfilled and committed to the organization’s cause.</p>

<hr />

<p>To be able to fully understand how to devise a good program on how to motivate volunteers, it is imperative to know the reasons why people volunteer.</p>

<p>These are the general reasons why people volunteer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To contribute to the community</li>
  <li>To utilize their skills and experiences</li>
  <li>To advocate for the organization’s cause</li>
  <li>To uncover one’s strengths</li>
  <li>To meet other people</li>
  <li>To join their peers</li>
  <li>To improve their job profiles</li>
  <li>To meet religious duties or cultural beliefs</li>
</ul>

<p>Each organization is different and recognition programs should be designed based on the organization’s core culture but there are general ways that can be applied in order to shape a good recognition program.</p>

<h4 id="priority">Priority</h4>

<p>Make recognition a priority and research for ways to continuously improve it. Assign someone in your organization to monitor and implement this.</p>

<h4 id="repetition">Repetition</h4>

<p>Try to do it as often as you can in an informal manner to sincerely show your appreciation <a href="http://biturlz.com/bxxLkvd">click reference</a>. Scheduling times to let volunteers know can be helpful to ensure we don’t forget in the busyness of things.</p>

<h4 id="ways">Ways</h4>

<p>Do appreciate people in different ways either verbal or written. Sometimes a nice note can make all the difference.</p>

<h4 id="customization">Customization</h4>

<p>Appreciate your volunteers in ways that appeals to them. Understand that each individual is different and so recognizing them should be based on their personality as well.</p>
