Every wise not-for-profit leader knows that Millennials are a force to reckon with in the non-profit industry. They have emerged as donors, volunteers, employees and leaders. A research paper published in 2013 reported that 72% of Millennials are eager to join non-profit organizations while 50% are willing to donate to charities on a monthly basis. This data shows the impact that millennials can contribute to non-profit organizations if they are tapped properly.</p>

<h3 id="what-millennials-want">What Millennials Want</h3>

<p>The first step in creating your plan and strategies in tapping millennials to join your organization is to uncover what they are looking for or want from a not-for-profit organization.</p>

<h4 id="1-go-digital">1. Go Digital</h4>

<p>Almost every millennial has access to the internet through a wide array of platforms that can either be via smartphones, tables, laptops etc. Ensure that your organization has strong visibility online. Optimize your website and keep your content as fresh as possible. Millennials are keener in sharing and campaigning for causes that are timely using materials that are visually appealing and easy to share. So put ample time and effort in updating your social media accounts to successfully keep millennials engaged. Make sure you are using modern technology systems internally, if you want them volunteering within your organization.</p>

<h4 id="2-show-results">2. Show Results</h4>

<p>Millennials are results-oriented individuals. They are highly motivated by success stories and emotional visuals. Use materials that show the difference or the impact of their contributions. They will not take interest in your cause if they do not know how their efforts and time can help in achieving the organization’s mission and vision.</p>

<h4 id="3-experience">3. Experience</h4>

<p>Millennials value camaraderie and teamwork. They like building relationships with senior people within the organization and receiving recognition for their efforts. Offer training and references to your millennial volunteers to give them experience to build their careers. This is a key factor in keeping millennials engaged and motivated.</p>
