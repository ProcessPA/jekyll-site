<h1 id="custom-numbering-for-action-items-and-motions">Custom Numbering for Action Items and Motions</h1>

<p>You now have the flexibility for numbering action items and motions to allow easy identification across meetings and the organization. It is composed of up to three parts <em>Prefix-Date-Count</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Prefix</strong> is any text</li>
  <li><strong>Date</strong> is <em>None</em>, <em>Day</em> (e.g. 170218), <em>Month</em> (e.g. 1702) or <em>Year</em> (e.g. 17)</li>
  <li>
    <div>
 <strong>Count</strong> is the incremental count of items starting from either
    </div>

    <ol>
      <li><em>Global</em>, which is all items</li>
      <li><em>Year</em>, resets to zero each year</li>
      <li><em>Meeting</em>, which starts the count at each meeting.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For example, a <strong>Prefix</strong></p>

<p><em>A</em>, <strong>Date</strong></p>

<p><em>Year</em> and <strong>Count</strong></p>

<p><em>Year</em> would be <span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>A-17-008</em>.</span> The numbers are calculated at the conclusion of the meeting and will be seen inline in the minutes and summary tables. Carried over actions or motions will maintain their numbers in the next agenda for easy tracking.</p>

<h1 id="time-limits">Time Limits</h1>

<p>We all want meetings to stay on time and to time. With that you can now set the end time for your meeting rather than the default of 1 hour. An very importantly for keeping things on track you can now set an allotted time for agenda items.</p>

<p>When scheduling the meeting you will now see the End Time available.</p>
