        <p>An association secretary is not to be confused with the office secretarial work. An office secretary is someone who is employed to assist with correspondence, keep records, make appointments and carry out confidential or similar tasks. The word itself was derived from the Latin word “<em>secretaries”</em> which means “confidential officer”. When talking about a association secretary we are referring to the duties like a company secretary which in essence is making sure records are correct for the company.</p>

Well marketing the achievements of your committee does take a lot of hard work but it can be done in easily and cost effectively as long as you understand the fundamentals of doing so.</p>
