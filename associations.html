            <p class="lead">For people on committees running associations or boards, much of the time the administration is done by people who put their hand up but did not receive training. There are many resources available that give guidance on what needs to be done but that takes more time than what people have to volunteer. Process PA provides a tool that guides the committee member through the role requirements and automatically performs many of the repetitive tasks.</p>
