                    We understand that there are many types of associations out there, from school P&amp;C, community groups to sporting clubs.
                    <br /><br />
                    Need  more people to get involved and help out? Tired of the conflict amongst the committee? Not receiving minutes until just before the next meeting? Questioning how compliant you really are if audited? Losing sleep that you may be personally liable?
                    <br /><br />
                    Use Process PA to take care of administration for you and free you to make a positive impact in your association.

            <p class="lead">For people on committees running associations or boards, the administration is often done by people who put their hand up but without training. There are many resources available that give guidance on what needs to be done, but that takes more time than people have to volunteer. Process PA provides a tool that guides the committee member through the role requirements and automatically performs many of the repetitive tasks.</p>
