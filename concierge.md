We are here to help you get started with a our free setup service.

### How it works

You just need to provide your agenda and notes from your last meeting, your members names and emails and we will take it from there. We will set up your account, enter your members, last meeting minutes, set template agendas and letterhead. Once complete, we will email you the minutes from Process PA and schedule a call to take your through how to use Process PA.

Your next meeting will be scheduled and ready to go for a productive meeting and instant minutes to trial for free.
