faq:
  - question: What is Process PA?
    answer: Process PA is your personal assistant guiding you through your governance requirements for your management committee or board.
  - question: How do I get started?
    answer: You can begin a free 30-day trial by registering at [https://app.processpa.com/Account/Register](https://app.processpa.com/Account/Register). For more details on getting setup go to [Help](/help.html).
  - question: Do I need all members to agree to move over to Process PA?
    answer: While we recommend approval from the members in most situations, Process PA has been built in a way that the main user, often the secretary, can take advantage of the improved process using Process PA without changing the process other members are currently doing. Everything can be emails as it was before (albeit faster with our PDF combining and attachment bundling) so members get all they need in their inbox. They do not even need to log in to the platform at all. That said, if they do there are other benefits like historial access to information that they can take advantage of.
  - question: How many board and committee members can I add?
    answer: You can add all your board directors and committee members. We do not charge per user, but keep pricing simple per organization. You can control if your members have access online, receive content only via email or can modify your content.
  - question: How can other members login?
    answer: After you have added the member and set their access level ([Manage Membership](/quick-start-guide/manage-membership)), the user can register with the same email address and log in. Note that on the emails that go out from Process PA contain a link to view online. If the member has created an account this will take them to the register page with their details filled out. All they need to do is set a password.
  - question: Does the site work offline?
    answer: Unfortunately no. We have optimized it to use very little data so that it works through mobile data quickly. An internet connection is required while taking minutes though. If a connection can't be obtained for the meeting, taking minutes the traditional way and entering them later into Process PA later still give other benefits of the system, such as distributions, consistency and continuity of records.
  - question: Can Ordinary Members access documents?
    answer: Members can be given either Administrator, Viewer or Email Only access. Administrators can modify everything, Viewers can only view everything and Email members only receive content via email. When other members register with Process PA, if they are members of any organizations those will be available for them to access.
  - question: What happens if a future committee decide not to continue using Process PA?
    answer: Everything can be download from Process PA at any time to be put elsewhere.
