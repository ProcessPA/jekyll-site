Process PA works on any browser on any device. For the best experience we recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com.au/chrome/) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge).

Note that there are currently two known issues with Safari:
1. You cannot set the start and end date for member terms due to browser feature incomplete (Also occurs on Internet Explorer).
2. Downloading agenda, minutes and attachments may get stuck on the Downloading popup and not trigger the Save As dialog.
