# Committee Folder Creation Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the steps to create a well-structured folder system for your committee documents. We will help you set up three levels of folders: root-level, second-level, and third-level. Each level will contain three folders, organized for easy navigation and document management.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create 3 Committee Root-Level Folders
1. Open the committee page for the active committee.
   - Example: Access the page for your specific committee.
   - 
   
2. Add three root-level folders:
   - Name the folders as follows:
     - `Root Level Folder 001`
     - `Root Level Folder 002`
     - `Root Level Folder 003`
   
### Step 2: Create 3 Committee Second-Level Folders
1. Open the same committee page for the active committee again.
   - 

2. Retrieve the list of folders to make sure you are working in the correct location.

3. Add three second-level folders under the appropriate root-level folder:
   - Name the folders as follows:
     - `2nd Level Folder 001`
     - `2nd Level Folder 002`
     - `2nd Level Folder 003`
   
### Step 3: Create 3 Committee Third-Level Folders
1. Once again, open the committee page for the active committee.
   - 

2. Add three third-level folders under the respective second-level folder:
   - Name the folders as follows:
     - `3rd Level Folder 001`
     - `3rd Level Folder 002`
     - `3rd Level Folder 003`

By following these steps, you will have organized your committee's documents in a hierarchical structure that promotes easy access and management. This structured approach helps in maintaining clarity and efficiency in your document handling.
