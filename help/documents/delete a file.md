## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to delete a single file from a specific folder in your document management system. This is a straightforward process that will help ensure your document organization remains tidy and up-to-date.

## Before You Start

**Important Considerations:**
- **Deletion is permanent** - make sure you really want to remove the file
- Verify you have appropriate permissions to delete files from the target folder
- Consider creating a backup or moving the file to an archive folder instead of permanent deletion
- Check if anyone else is currently using or referencing the file

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Your Committee Documents
1. Navigate to the document management system using your committee credentials
2. Open the documents page for your active committee
3. Wait for the page to load completely and display your folder structure

### Step 2: Navigate to the File Location
1. Browse through your folder structure to locate the folder containing the file you want to delete
2. Click on the target folder to open it and view its contents
3. Allow the folder contents to load fully before proceeding

### Step 3: Locate and Select the File
1. Find the specific file you want to delete in the file list
2. Review the file details to ensure you've identified the correct file:
   - Check the file name and extension
   - Verify the file size and date modified
   - Confirm it's the file you intend to remove
3. Click on the file to select it (look for highlighting or selection indicators)

### Step 4: Initiate the Delete Process
1. Look for delete options in your interface:
   - Right-click on the file to open the context menu and select "Delete"
   - Use a "Delete" button in the toolbar or action panel
   - Press the Delete key on your keyboard after selecting the file
   - Look for a trash can icon or delete symbol
2. Choose your preferred deletion method based on available options

### Step 5: Confirm the Deletion
1. A confirmation dialog will typically appear asking if you're sure you want to delete the file
2. **Read the confirmation message carefully** - it may indicate whether deletion is permanent or if the file goes to a recycle bin
3. Review the file name one final time to ensure it's correct
4. Click "Delete," "Yes," or "Confirm" to proceed with the deletion
5. Wait for the system to process the deletion request

### Step 6: Verify Successful Deletion
1. **Check the folder contents**:
   - Confirm the deleted file no longer appears in the folder
   - Verify the remaining files are still present and intact
   - Look for any success messages confirming the deletion
2. **Check system trash/recycle bin** (if applicable):
   - Some systems move deleted files to a trash folder rather than permanent deletion
   - Locate your system's trash or recycle bin to see if the file can be recovered if needed
3. **Test folder functionality**:
   - Ensure the folder still functions properly after the deletion
   - Verify that deleting the file didn't affect other files or folder structure

### Step 7: Complete the Process
1. Once you've confirmed the successful deletion, you can continue with other tasks
2. Update any documentation that may have referenced the deleted file
3. Inform relevant team members if the deleted file was shared or referenced elsewhere
