# How to Delete a Single File

## Overview
In this guide, we will go through the simple steps to delete a single file from a specific folder within your organization's document management system. By following these instructions, you'll be able to manage your files more effectively and keep your document library organized. 

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Committee's Document Page**
   - Navigate to the document management system and open the relevant committee by selecting its ID. This could be a unique identifier for your committee, such as `ActiveCommittee123`.

2. **Select the Folder**
   - Once you are on the committee's document page, locate the desired folder you want to work in. For this example, select the folder named `1-0-0`.

   

3. **Delete the File**
   - With the appropriate folder open, you will now delete the specific file. Choose the file you want to delete. In this case, you will delete the file identified by `0` from the selected folder.

   

4. **Validate the Deletion**
   - After deleting the file, it's essential to confirm that the deletion was successful. You can check the remaining files in the respective folders to ensure that the intended file has been removed. In our example, the expected files left in the folder `1` should include file `0`, and other folders should reflect the correct list of files.

   - The validation will ensure that your document organization remains intact after the deletion, showing files in folders such as `1`, `2`, `1-0`, and `1-0-0` appropriately.

Remember, maintaining an organized document library is crucial for effective business operations. If you follow these steps, you'll be able to manage your files confidently.
