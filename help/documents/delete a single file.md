## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open the Relevant Committee

### Step 2: Select the Appropriate Folder

1. Find and select the folder named `1-0-0` where the file you wish to delete is located.



### Step 3: Delete the File

1. Select the file you want to delete. In this case, delete the file with the identifier `0`.
  


### Step 4: Validate the Deletion

1. Check the remaining files in the folders to ensure that the deletion was successful.
   - For folder `1`, confirm that the file list includes only `[0]`.
   - For folder `2`, verify that all sample files are still present.
   - For folder `1-0`, ensure that files `[0, 1, 2, 3]` remain.
   - For folder `1-0-0`, check that only files `[1, 2, 3]` are left.
