## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Your Committee Documents
1. **Navigate to the Documents Section**
   - Open your document management system using your committee credentials
   - Access the documents page for your active committee
   - Wait for the page to load completely and display your folder structure

### Step 2: Navigate to the Target Folder
1. **Locate Your Target Folder**
   - Browse through your folder structure to find the folder containing files you want to delete
   - Click on the target folder to open it and view its contents
   - Allow the folder contents to load fully before proceeding with file selection

### Step 3: Select Multiple Files for Deletion
1. **Choose Your Selection Method**
   - **Individual selection**: Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while clicking each file you want to delete
   - **Range selection**: Click the first file, then hold Shift and click the last file to select all files in between
   - **Checkbox selection**: Use checkboxes next to each file if available
   - **Select all**: Use "Select All" option if deleting all files in the folder

2. **Verify Your Selection**
   - Look for visual indicators (checkmarks, highlighting, or selection counters) to confirm your selections
   - Review the list of selected files carefully to ensure you haven't included files you want to keep
   - Take note of file names and count before proceeding

### Step 4: Initiate the Delete Process
1. **Access Delete Options**
   - Look for delete functionality in your interface:
     - A "Delete Selected" or "Delete" button in the toolbar
     - Right-click context menu with "Delete" option
     - Delete key on your keyboard after selecting files
     - Trash can icon or delete symbol in the interface

2. **Choose Your Deletion Method**
   - Select your preferred method based on your system's available features
   - Some systems may offer bulk delete options specifically for multiple files

### Step 5: Confirm Multiple File Deletion
1. **Review the Confirmation Dialog**
   - A confirmation dialog will appear showing the number of files to be deleted
   - **Carefully review the list** of files that will be deleted
   - Check if the deletion is permanent or if files will go to a recycle bin
   - Verify the file count matches your intended selection

2. **Proceed with Caution**
   - Read any warning messages about permanent deletion
   - Ensure you're absolutely certain about proceeding
   - Click "Delete," "Yes," or "Confirm" to execute the deletion
   - Wait for the system to process all file deletions

### Step 6: Verify Successful Deletion
1. **Check the Folder Contents**
   - Confirm that all selected files have been removed from the folder
   - Verify that only the intended files remain in the folder
   - Look for success messages confirming the deletion count

2. **Validate System Status**
   - Refresh the folder view to ensure changes are properly reflected
   - Check that the folder structure remains intact after deletions
   - Verify that remaining files are still accessible and functional

3. **Check Recovery Options** (if available)
   - Locate your system's trash or recycle bin to confirm deleted files are recoverable if needed
   - Note any time limits for file recovery in your system

### Step 7: Complete the Process
1. **Final Verification**
   - Double-check that your folder organization meets your expectations
   - Ensure no unintended files were deleted during the process
   - Verify that remaining files are properly organized
