# How to Delete Multiple Files in Your Document Management System

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the steps to delete multiple files from a specific folder in your document management system. This can be useful when you want to clean up outdated documents or organize your files more efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Document Management System**  
   Begin by opening the document management system and navigating to the specific committee associated with your files.

2. **Select the Folder**  
   Find and select the folder you want to delete files from. For example, you might choose the folder named `1-0-0`.

   

3. **Delete the Files**  
   Once you are in the correct folder, select the files you wish to delete. In our example, we will delete the files with identifiers `0` and `1`.

   

4. **Validate the Deletion**  
   After the deletion, it is essential to confirm that the files have been removed. Check that the remaining files in the folder now reflect your changes. For instance, you should verify that:
   - The folder `1` still contains [0].
   - The folder `2` has all original files.
   - The folder `1-0` now has files [0, 1, 2, 3].
   - The folder `1-0-0` should only have file [3] left.

   

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and delete multiple files, keeping your document management system organized and up to date.
