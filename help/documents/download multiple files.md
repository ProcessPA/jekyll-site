## Overview

This guide provides instructions on how to download multiple files from a specific folder within your document management system. You will learn how to navigate to the desired folder and select multiple files for download efficiently.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- Access to your committee's document management system
- Sufficient storage space on your device for all selected files
- Appropriate permissions to download files from the target folder
- A stable internet connection for downloading multiple files

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Your Committee's Documents
1. Navigate to the document management system using your committee credentials
2. Open the documents page for your active committee
3. Wait for the page to load completely before proceeding

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Target Folder
1. Browse through your folder structure to locate the folder containing the files you want to download
2. Click on the desired folder to open it and view its contents
3. Allow the folder contents to load fully before selecting files

### Step 3: Select Multiple Files for Download
1. Choose your selection method:
   - **Individual selection**: Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while clicking each file you want to download
   - **Range selection**: Click the first file, then hold Shift and click the last file to select all files in between
   - **Select all**: Use "Select All" option if you want to download all files in the folder
2. Look for visual indicators (such as checkmarks or highlighting) to confirm your selections
3. Verify that you've selected the correct number of files before proceeding

### Step 4: Initiate the Download Process
1. Look for download options such as:
   - A "Download Selected" button
   - A "Download" option in the toolbar
   - Right-click context menu with download options
2. Click the appropriate download button to start the process
3. Choose whether to download files individually or as a compressed archive (zip file) if the option is available

### Step 5: Monitor Download Progress
1. Watch for download progress indicators in your browser
2. Be patient as multiple files may take longer to download than single files
3. Note that some systems may download files sequentially rather than simultaneously
4. Keep the browser window open until all downloads are complete

### Step 6: Verify All Downloads
1. Navigate to your downloads folder or chosen save location
2. Count the downloaded files to ensure the number matches your selection
3. Check file sizes to verify downloads completed successfully
4. Test opening a few files to confirm they aren't corrupted
5. Look for any error messages or failed download notifications

### Step 7: Complete the Process
1. Once all downloads are verified as successful, you can close the document management page
2. Consider organizing the downloaded files into appropriate folders on your device
3. Clean up your browser's download history if desired

## Troubleshooting Multiple Downloads

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Downloads fail or stop midway:**
- Check your internet connection stability
- Try downloading in smaller batches
- Restart your browser and try again

**Some files missing from downloads:**
- Verify you had permission to access all selected files
- Check if any files were too large for your system
- Look for partially downloaded files that may need to be re-downloaded

**Browser becomes unresponsive:**
- Reduce the number of simultaneous downloads
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
- Consider using a download manager for large batches

**Downloaded files won't open:**
- Ensure you have appropriate software for each file type
- Check if files are corrupted by comparing file sizes
- Re-download any problematic files individually

## Best Practices for Multiple Downloads

- **Batch size**: Download files in manageable batches (10-20 files at a time) to avoid system overload
- **Storage management**: Ensure adequate disk space before starting large downloads
- **Network considerations**: Schedule large downloads during off-peak hours if possible
- **Backup originals**: Keep original files in the document management system as backups

## System-Specific Notes

- **Mobile devices**: Multiple downloads may be limited on mobile browsers
- **Corporate networks**: Some organizations may restrict simultaneous downloads
- **File size limits**: Large files may require individual download rather than batch processing
- **Browser compatibility**: Different browsers may handle multiple downloads differently
