## Overview

This guide will help you move a single file from one folder to another within your business document management system. The steps provided will ensure that the file is correctly relocated and that the organization of your documents remains intact.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open The Relevant Committee
1. Access the documents page using your active committee ID. This will allow you to view all folders and files associated with your committee.

### 2. Select The Source Folder
1. Locate and select the folder named `1-0`. This is the folder where the file you want to move is currently located.



### 3. Move The File
1. Initiate the process to move files. Specify the file to be moved (in this case, the file with ID `0`) and choose the target folder (folder `3`) where the file will be transferred.



### 4. Validate The File Move
1. Confirm that the move was successful by checking the contents of all relevant folders:
   - In folder `1`, ensure it contains the file `0`.
   - In folder `2`, verify it has all the files from the provided list.
   - In folder `3`, ensure it now contains the file that was moved.
   - Check folder `1-0` to confirm it still has files `1`, `2`, and `3`.
   - Finally, in folder `1-0-0`, ensure it has the file `3`.

This process will help ensure that your files are well-organized and easy to find within your business document structure.
