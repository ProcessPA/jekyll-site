## Overview

This guide will help you understand how to move a single file from one folder to another within a document management system. The process is straightforward and can be done in just a few easy steps. 

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open The Desired Document Page
1. Navigate to the documents page by using your active committee ID.
   
### Step 2: Select The Folder
1. Look for the folder titled `1-0` and select it. 

### Step 3: Move The File
1. Identify the file you want to move, which in this case is the first file (`0`) in the folder.
2. Move this file to the target folder labeled `3`.

### Step 4: Validate The Move
1. Check the contents of the folder `1` to confirm that it now contains the moved file (`0`).
2. Ensure that folder `2` includes all the initial files that were present.
3. Confirm that the newly moved file appears in folder `3`.
4. Double-check that folder `1-0` continues to contain files `1`, `2`, and `3` as before.
5. Finally, verify that folder `1-0-0` now has file `3` included.
