# Moving a Single File: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you move a single file from one folder to another within the documents section. By following these simple steps, you will be able to organize your business documents efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Active Committee**  
   Start by opening the relevant section for the active committee. Locate the area that corresponds to your current active committee.

   

2. **Select the Desired Folder**  
   Navigate to the folder where the file you want to move is currently located. For this example, select the folder named `1-0`.

   

3. **Move the File**  
   Choose the file you wish to move. In this case, you will be moving a specific file identified as `0` to a new folder identified as `3`. 

   

4. **Validate the Move**  
   After moving the file, it is important to check that the move was successful. You should verify that:
   - Folder `1` now contains no files corresponding to the moved file.
   - Folder `2` retains its original files.
   - Folder `3` should now contain the file you just moved.
   - Check that folder `1-0` has the remaining files in it.
   - Ensure folder `1-0-0` maintains its contents as expected.
  
This validation step ensures everything is in the right place after the move.

   

By successfully completing these steps, you've effectively moved your file within the document management system!
