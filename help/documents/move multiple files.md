# Moving Multiple Files: A Simple Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the process of moving multiple files from one folder to another within your document management system. You'll learn how to open the appropriate folder, select the files you want to move, and validate that the files have been successfully relocated.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open Your Committee's Document Section**
   - Begin by accessing the document section for your active committee. Look for the committee ID related to your documents and open it.

2. **Select the Source Folder**
   - Navigate to the folder labeled `1-0`. This is where your files are currently stored.



3. **Choose Files to Move**
   - You will select the files you want to move. In this example, you are moving files `0` and `1`.

4. **Move the Selected Files**
   - Once you've selected the files, initiate the move to the folder labeled `1-1`. This will transfer the chosen files to their new location.



5. **Validate the Move**
   - After the move, check to ensure that the files are in the correct folders. 
     - Folder `1` should now only contain file `0`.
     - Folder `2` should contain all existing files.
     - Folder `3` should only have file `0`.
     - The original folder `1-0` should now have only file `3`.
     - The newly designated folder `1-1` should now contain files `1` and `2`.
     - Finally, the subfolder `1-0-0` should still contain file `3`.

This process ensures that your file organization remains clear and efficient, making it easier for everyone to access the documents they need.
