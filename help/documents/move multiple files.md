## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to move multiple files within your document management system. Users will learn how to navigate through folders, select specific files, and accurately move them to a designated destination folder.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- Access to your committee's document management system
- Permission to move files between folders
- Clear understanding of your source and destination folder locations
- Knowledge of which specific files need to be relocated

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Your Committee Documents
1. Navigate to the document management system using your committee credentials
2. Open the documents page for your active committee
3. Wait for the page to load completely and display your folder structure

### Step 2: Navigate to the Source Folder
1. Browse through your folder structure to locate the folder containing the files you want to move
2. Click on the source folder to open it and view its contents
3. Take note of the files available for selection

### Step 3: Select Multiple Files for Moving
1. Choose your selection method:
   - **Individual selection**: Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while clicking each file you want to move
   - **Range selection**: Click the first file, then hold Shift and click the last file to select all files in between
   - **Checkbox selection**: Use checkboxes next to each file if available
2. Look for visual indicators (checkmarks, highlighting, or selection counters) to confirm your selections
3. Verify you've selected the correct files before proceeding with the move

### Step 4: Initiate the Move Process
1. Look for move options in your interface:
   - A "Move" or "Move Selected" button in the toolbar
   - "Cut" option followed by "Paste" in destination
   - Drag-and-drop functionality to move files directly
   - Right-click context menu with "Move to" options
2. Choose your preferred method based on your system's available features

### Step 5: Select Destination Folder
1. If using a move dialog:
   - Browse through the folder tree to find your destination folder
   - Click on the target folder to select it
   - Confirm your destination choice
2. If using drag-and-drop:
   - Navigate to show both source and destination folders
   - Drag selected files to the destination folder
3. If using cut/paste:
   - Cut the selected files from the source location
   - Navigate to the destination folder
   - Paste the files in the new location

### Step 6: Confirm and Execute the Move
1. Review the move operation details if a confirmation dialog appears
2. Verify that the source and destination folders are correct
3. Confirm the number of files being moved matches your selection
4. Execute the move operation and wait for completion

### Step 7: Verify Successful File Movement
1. **Check the destination folder**:
   - Navigate to the destination folder
   - Confirm all moved files now appear in this location
   - Verify the file count matches your original selection
2. **Check the source folder**:
   - Return to the original source folder
   - Confirm the moved files are no longer present in the original location
   - Ensure no files were accidentally left behind
3. **Test file accessibility**:
   - Open one or two moved files to ensure they work properly
   - Verify that file properties and permissions remain intact

## Tips for Moving Multiple Files

### Efficient Selection Strategies
- **Use search filters** to quickly locate files that need to be moved
- **Sort files by date or type** to make selection easier
- **Select files in batches** if moving large numbers to avoid system overload

### Organization Best Practices
- **Plan your folder structure** before moving files to ensure logical organization
- **Create new folders** if needed to accommodate the moved files
- **Maintain consistent naming conventions** across your folder structure

### Safety Precautions
- **Start with a small test batch** if you're unfamiliar with the move process
- **Keep track of what you're moving** by writing down file names or taking screenshots
- **Avoid moving critical files** during busy periods when others might be accessing them

## Troubleshooting Multiple File Moves

### Common Issues

**Not all files moved successfully:**
- Some files may have been locked by other users
- Check permissions for each file individually
- Retry the move operation for any failed files

**Files appear duplicated:**
- You may have copied instead of moved the files
- Check both source and destination folders
- Delete duplicates from the unintended location

**Move operation takes too long:**
- Large files or many files can slow down the process
- Be patient and avoid interrupting the operation
- Consider moving files in smaller batches

**Cannot access moved files:**
- Check that destination folder permissions are correct
- Verify that file associations are maintained
- Contact your system administrator if access issues persist

### Prevention Tips
- **Double-check selections** before initiating the move
- **Ensure stable internet connection** for cloud-based systems
- **Avoid moving files during system maintenance windows**
- **Keep a record** of important file relocations for future reference

## When to Move Multiple Files

### Good Reasons to Move Files
- **Project reorganization**: Moving related files into project-specific folders
- **Archive management**: Moving old files to archive folders
- **Access control**: Moving files to folders with appropriate permission levels
- **Storage optimization**: Moving large files to designated storage areas

### Consider Alternatives
- **Creating shortcuts or links** instead of moving frequently accessed files
- **Using tags or metadata** for organization without changing file locations
- **Copying files** when multiple people need access from different locations
