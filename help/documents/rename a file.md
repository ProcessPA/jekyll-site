## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to rename a file within your document management system. Following these instructions will ensure that your renaming process is straightforward and efficient.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- Access to your committee's document management area
- Permission to edit files in the selected folder
- The new file name decided (following any naming conventions your organization uses)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Access Your Documents
1. Navigate to the document management area for your active committee
2. Enter your committee credentials if prompted

### Navigate to Your File
1. Browse through your folder structure to locate the file you want to rename
2. Click on the folder containing your target file to open it

### Locate and Select the File
1. Find the file you wish to rename in the file list
2. Look for rename options by either:
   - Right-clicking on the file to open the context menu
   - Clicking on the file and looking for an "Edit" or "Rename" button
   - Hovering over the file to reveal action icons

### Rename the File
1. Click on the "Rename" option or edit icon
2. Clear the current file name or select all text
3. Type your new file name (for example: "quarterly-report-2025.pdf")
4. Ensure you keep the original file extension (like .pdf, .docx, .txt) unless specifically changing file types
5. Click "Save," "Confirm," or press Enter to apply the change

### Verify the Name Change
1. Check that the file now appears with your new name in the file list
2. Look for any confirmation messages indicating successful rename
3. Ensure the file is still accessible and hasn't been corrupted during the rename process

### Complete the Process
1. Once you've confirmed the rename was successful, you can continue working or close the document management area
2. Consider updating any links or references to the old file name if they exist elsewhere

## Best Practices for File Naming

- **Use descriptive names**: Choose names that clearly indicate the file's content or purpose
- **Avoid special characters**: Stick to letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
- **Include dates when relevant**: Use formats like "2025-06-09" for consistency
- **Keep it concise**: Aim for clear but not overly long file names
- **Follow organizational standards**: Check if your organization has specific naming conventions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while renaming:
- **Permission denied**: Contact your administrator to verify you have edit permissions
- **Invalid characters**: Remove any special characters that aren't allowed
- **Name already exists**: Choose a different name or add a version number
- **Changes not saving**: Refresh the page and try again, or check your internet connection

## Important Notes

- **File extensions**: Be careful not to accidentally change the file extension unless you intend to convert the file type
- **Linked files**: Remember that changing a file name may break links to that file in other documents or systems
- **Version control**: Consider including version numbers in file names for better document management
- **Backup**: For critical files, consider creating a backup before renaming in case you need to revert changes
