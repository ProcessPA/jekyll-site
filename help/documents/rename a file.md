# How to Rename a File in Your Document Management System

## Overview
Renaming a file in your document management system is a straightforward process that helps you keep your documents organized and easily identifiable. Follow the simple steps below to rename a file efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Document Set**: Start by opening the specific document set that contains the file you want to rename. For example, if you are managing documents for a committee, navigate to that committee's section.

2. **Select the Relevant Folder**: Once you have accessed the document set, select the folder where your target file is located. For instance, you might select a folder named `Quarterly Reports`.

   

3. **Find and Rename the File**: Look for the file you wish to rename. In our example, the file to rename is identified as `report-2023-q1.txt`. Change its name to something more suitable, such as `report-2023-q1-renamed.txt`.

   

4. **Verify the Change**: After renaming the file, check the file list to confirm that the renaming was successful. Ensure that the file's new name, `report-2023-q1-renamed.txt`, appears correctly in the folder.

5. **Close the Document Management System**: Once you have verified the renaming process, you can close the document management system to finish your task.

By following these steps, you can easily rename files and maintain an organized document structure.
