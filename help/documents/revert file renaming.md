# Reverting File Renaming in Your Document Management System

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the steps to revert a file renaming action in your document management system. In our example, we will demonstrate how to rename a file back to its original name, ensuring all your business documents remain organized and easy to locate.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Committee's Document Page**
   - Begin by accessing the document page for your active committee. This step ensures you are navigating within the correct context and have the right files available for modification.
   
2. **Select the Relevant Folder**
   - Once you are on the document page, locate and select the folder numbered `1` where the file you need to revert is stored. This will help in narrowing down your search within the document hierarchy.

3. **Rename the File**
   - Identify the file you want to revert. In this case, it is the file with the identifier `0`. You will proceed to rename this file to `sample-001.txt`. This action is important for maintaining clear and meaningful file names in your business operations.

4. **Verify the Renaming Action**
   - After renaming, check the file list to confirm that the renaming action was successful. Look for the file with the original identifier (`0`) and verify that its new name is indeed `sample-001.txt`. This ensures that your changes have taken effect correctly.

5. **Close the Document Management Page**
   - Finally, close the document management page once you have completed the naming and verification steps to finish the process.

Following these steps will help you efficiently manage your documents by reverting any unwanted name changes and maintaining proper organization.
