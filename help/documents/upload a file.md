## Overview

This guide explains how to upload files to your document management system. You can upload files to different folder levels depending on how you want to organize your documents.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- Access to your committee's document management page

- Appropriate permissions to upload files to the selected folder

## Step-by-Step Upload Process

Follow these steps to upload a file to any folder level in your document management system:

1. **Access your documents**: Open the document management page for your active committee

2. **Navigate to your desired folder**: 
   - For main folder uploads: Click on the primary folder in your hierarchy
   - For sub-folder uploads: Click on the appropriate second-level folder within your main folder structure
   - For sub-sub-folder uploads: Click through the folder structure to reach the third-level folder where you want to store your document

3. **Start the upload**: Click the "Upload" or "Add File" button

4. **Choose your file**: Browse and select the file from your computer

5. **Complete the upload**: Click "Upload" or "Confirm" to finish

7. **Close when finished**: Exit the document management page

## Tips for Success

- **File size limits**: Check if your system has file size restrictions before uploading large documents
- **Supported formats**: Ensure your file is in a supported format (common formats include PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and images)
- **Naming convention**: Use clear, descriptive file names to make documents easy to find later
- **Organization**: Choose the appropriate folder level based on how specific or general your document is

## Troubleshooting

If your upload fails:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the file isn't corrupted
