## Step-by-Step Upload Process

Follow these steps to upload multiple files to any folder level in your document management system:

1. **Open The Documents Page**
   - Navigate to the documents page for your active committee

2. **Select Your Desired Folder**
   - For main folder uploads: Click on the primary folder in your hierarchy
   - For sub-folder uploads: Click on the appropriate second-level folder within your main folder structure  
   - For sub-sub-folder uploads: Click through the folder structure to reach the third-level folder where you want to store your documents

3. **Start The Upload Process**
   - Click the "Upload" or "Add Files" button
   - Look for options like "Select Multiple Files" or "Browse Files"

4. **Select Your Files**
   - Choose all the files you want to upload from your computer
   - You can typically select multiple files by:
     - Holding Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while clicking individual files
     - Using Shift to select a range of files
     - Using "Select All" if uploading all files from a folder

5. **Complete The Upload**
   - Click "Upload" or "Confirm" to start uploading all selected files
   - Wait for the upload process to complete (larger files may take longer)

6. **Verify Upload Success**
   - Check that the number of uploaded files matches the number of files you selected
   - Confirm all files appear in the correct folder
   - Look for success messages or upload completion indicators

7. **Close The Page**
   - Once all uploads are verified as successful, close the documents page

## Tips for Multiple File Uploads

- **File organization**: Consider organizing files on your computer before uploading to make selection easier
- **Upload limits**: Check if there are restrictions on the number of files you can upload at once
- **File size considerations**: Large files or many files may take longer to upload
- **Naming consistency**: Use consistent file naming conventions for better organization
- **Batch uploads**: For very large numbers of files, consider uploading in smaller batches

## Troubleshooting

If your upload encounters issues:
- Verify your internet connection is stable
- Check if any files are corrupted or in unsupported formats
- Ensure you have sufficient storage space
- Confirm upload permissions for the selected folder
- Try uploading files in smaller batches if uploading many files at once
- Refresh the page and retry if the upload process stalls
