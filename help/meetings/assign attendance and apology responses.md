# Assigning Attendance and Apology Responses

## Overview
This guide will help you assign attendance and apology responses for a meeting. This ensures that all members are accounted for, allowing you to plan effectively. You will learn how to mark some members as attending and others as unable to attend, leaving some members without any assigned responses. 

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Meeting Page:**
   - Access the meeting by opening the specific meeting page associated with your active meeting.

2. **Assign Attendance Responses:**
   - Mark two members as attending the meeting. These members will be indicated as present.

3. **Assign Apology Responses:**
   - Mark two members as unable to attend (apologies). These members will be noted as excused from the meeting.

4. **Leave Unassigned Members:**
   - Leave four members without any responses. This means that these members have not yet been marked as either attending or apologizing.

5. **Close the Meeting Page:**
   - After assigning the responses, make sure to close the meeting page to save all changes and exit the process. 

Remember to check that attendance and apologies are noted correctly before closing. This helps ensure accurate records for future reference.
