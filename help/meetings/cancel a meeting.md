# Canceling Committee Meetings

## Overview

This guide explains how to cancel scheduled meetings when they can no longer take place as planned. Canceling a meeting properly ensures participants are notified and your committee's schedule remains accurate.

## When to Cancel a Meeting

You should cancel a meeting when:
- Key participants cannot attend and the meeting cannot proceed
- Urgent circumstances prevent the meeting from occurring
- Required information or materials are not ready
- External factors make the meeting impossible (weather, technical issues, etc.)
- The meeting's purpose is no longer relevant or necessary

## Difference Between Canceling and Deleting

**Canceling a Meeting** - Marks the meeting as cancelled while keeping a record that it was scheduled. Participants receive cancellation notifications.

**Deleting a Meeting** - Completely removes the meeting from the system as if it never existed.

Most situations call for cancellation rather than deletion, as it maintains a proper record and communicates changes to participants.

## How to Cancel a Meeting

### Accessing Your Meetings
Navigate to your committee's meetings page using your committee ID or by selecting your committee from the meeting page. This will display all scheduled meetings for your committee.

### Locating the Meeting to Cancel
Browse through your meeting list to find the specific meeting you need to cancel. Look for:
- The meeting title or description
- Meeting date and time
- Meeting type (General, Special, Annual)

Click on or select the meeting you want to cancel to access its options.

### Initiating the Cancellation
1. Look for the "Cancel" option associated with your selected meeting either in the toolbar or context menu.

2. Click on the cancel option.

### Confirming the Cancellation
1. The system will typically ask you to confirm that you want to cancel the meeting. This prevents accidental cancellations and gives you a chance to review your decision.

2. Confirm that you want to proceed with the cancellation by clicking the "Cancel Meeting" button.

### Verifying the Cancellation
After confirming, check that:
- The meeting now shows as "Cancelled" in your meetings list
- Other scheduled meetings remain unaffected
- The meeting status has been properly updated

## What Happens When You Cancel

**Immediate Changes:**
- Meeting status changes to "Cancelled"
- Automated reminders stop being sent
- Meeting room reservations are released

**Record Keeping:**
- The meeting remains in your system as a cancelled event
- Meeting history and any prepared materials are preserved
