# Closing a Meeting Without Finalization

## Overview
Closing a meeting without finalization allows you to end a meeting session without completing the final steps or documentation typically required. This process can be useful in various business scenarios, such as when a meeting needs to end unexpectedly or if you want to pause for further discussions later.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open the Meeting
- Navigate to your meeting dashboard and open the meeting you want to close. You will need the current `activeMeetingId` for this.

### Step 2: Ensure the Meeting is Started
- Wait for the meeting to reach the "Started" state. This indicates that the meeting is currently in progress.

### Step 3: Close the Meeting
- Proceed to close the meeting without finalizing it. Select the option for a non-finalized closure.

### Step 4: Confirm the Meeting Closure
- After attempting to close the meeting, verify the status. The meeting should now show as "Closed."

### Step 5: Exit the Meeting Page
- Close the meeting page to finalize your actions.

### Step 6: Close the Meeting Again (if needed)
- If you need to close the same meeting again shortly after, return to the meeting dashboard and open the meeting again using the `activeMeetingId`.

### Step 7: Wait for the Meeting to Pause
- Allow the meeting state to change to "Paused" before taking further actions.

### Step 8: Close the Meeting Again
- Once the meeting is paused, select the option to close the meeting without finalizing it again.

### Step 9: Confirm Closure Once More
- Similar to the first closure, check that the meeting state now reflects as "Closed."

### Step 10: Exit the Meeting Page Once More
- Finally, close the meeting page to complete the process.

This guide provides a clear path for closing a meeting without finalization while ensuring that you have the necessary checks in place for meeting states throughout the process.
