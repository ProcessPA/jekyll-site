Overview
--------
This guide will walk you through the process of closing a meeting without finalization. This can be useful if you need to end a meeting without formally concluding all discussions or actions taken during that meeting. Follow the steps below for both first-time and second-time closures.

Step-by-Step Guide
-------------------
### Close A Meeting Without Finalization (First Time)

1. **Open The Meeting Page**
   - Navigate to the meeting interface using the active meeting ID. This is usually found in your current meetings list.

2. **Wait For The Meeting To Start**
   - Keep an eye on the meeting status until it shows that the meeting has started (look for Meeting State as Started).

3. **Close The Meeting**
   - Use the option to close the meeting without finalizing any decisions or actions taken during the session. Make sure to select the option that indicates no finalization is needed.

4. **Confirm The Meeting State**
   - Check the meeting state again to ensure it now shows as Closed.

5. **Close The Meeting Interface**
   - Exit or close the meeting application to finish the process.
   
### Close A Meeting Without Finalization (Second Time)

1. **Open The Meeting Page Again**
   - Access the meeting interface using the same active meeting ID.

2. **Wait For The Meeting To Be Paused**
   - Monitor the status and wait until you see that the meeting is paused (look for Meeting State as Paused).

3. **Close The Meeting Once More**
   - Repeat the process of closing the meeting without finalization, selecting the same option as before.

4. **Check The Meeting Status Again**
   - Verify that the meeting state now correctly indicates that it is Closed.

5. **Final Step: Close The Meeting Interface**
   - Finally, exit or close the meeting application to complete the session closure. 

By following these steps, you will successfully close a meeting without finalization.
