# Configuring the Opener of a Meeting

## Overview
This guide will help you understand how to set up the opener for a meeting using a simple process. You will also learn how to define a specific starting time for your meeting opener, which is very useful for better organizing your agenda.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Configuring the Opener of a Meeting
1. **Open the Meeting:**
   - First, you will need to open your meeting. Look for the active meeting you want to configure in your system.

2. **Wait for the Meeting to Start:**
   - Wait until the meeting state indicates that it has started. This ensures that all settings can be applied properly.

3. **Set the Meeting Opener:**
   - You can set the meeting opener to `0` which means the standard opener will be used. This is often a brief introduction that everyone recognizes.

4. **Confirm the Meeting State:**
   - Double-check that the meeting is indeed in the "Started" state. This step is crucial to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

5. **Close the Meeting:**
   - Once you have set the opener, you will need to close the meeting configuration page.

### Configuring the Opener with an Explicit Meeting Open Time
1. **Open the Meeting:**
   - As in the previous steps, start by accessing your active meeting.

2. **Wait for the Meeting to Start:**
   - Allow some time until the system confirms that the meeting state shows it has started.

3. **Set the Meeting Opener with Time:**
   - This time, you'll set the meeting opener to `1`, and specify the time as `12:30`. This allows the meeting to have a more personalized introduction set at a specified time.

4. **Confirm the Meeting State:**
   - Again, confirm that the meeting state is still "Started" to ensure the new settings are applied.

5. **Close the Meeting:**
   - Finally, close the meeting setup page once you have completed all configurations. 

Now you are all set to have structured and organized meetings with defined openers!
