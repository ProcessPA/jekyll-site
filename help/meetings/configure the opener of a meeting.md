## Overview
This document outlines the steps to configure the opener of a meeting. You can set the meeting opener to different values and specify an explicit time for the meeting to open. This ensures your meeting starts on time and is well organized.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Configure The Opener Without Explicit Time
1. Launch the meeting page by navigating to the relevant `meetingPage`.
2. Open your meeting by using the current `meetingId`. 
3. Wait until the meeting state changes to "Started".
4. Set the meeting opener to the first option by selecting '0'.
5. Confirm the meeting state is still "Started" to ensure the configuration took effect.
6. Close the meeting page.

### Configure The Opener With Explicit Meeting Open Time

2. Open your meeting using the current `meetingId`.
3. Wait for the meeting to reach the "Started" state.
4. Set the meeting opener to the second option by selecting '1' and specify the time as '12:30'.
5. Check that the meeting state remains "Started" to verify the configuration.
6. Close the meeting page.
