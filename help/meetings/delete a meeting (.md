# How to Delete a Meeting in Your Committee Schedule

## Overview
Deleting a meeting from your committee schedule can be necessary for various reasons, such as changes in plans or rescheduling. This guide outlines the steps for removing a meeting, including different options for replacing or copying it. Whether you want to delete a meeting without replacement, replace it with another meeting of the same type, or replace it with a copy, you’ll find clear instructions here.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Delete a Meeting Without Replacement
1. Open the meetings page for your active committee. You can find this by looking up your committee ID.
2. Locate the meeting you want to delete. In this case, it’s the meeting labeled as `1`.
3. Choose to delete the meeting without creating a replacement.
4. Confirm that the meeting has been successfully removed from your schedule. You should see that there are now no meetings in that spot.
5. Close the meetings page once you've confirmed the deletion.

### 2. Delete a Meeting and Replace With Same Type
1. Again, open the meetings page for your active committee using your committee ID.
2. Find the meeting you want to replace. This time, it’s the meeting identified as `0`.
3. Select the option to delete the meeting while replacing it with another meeting of the same type.
4. Verify that the replacement has been correctly added to your schedule. You should now see an updated list of meetings.
5. Close the meetings page after confirming the changes.

### 3. Delete a Meeting and Replace With a Copy
1. Open the meetings page for your active committee using your committee ID.
2. Identify the meeting, which is also labeled as `0`, that you wish to delete.
3. Choose to delete this meeting while replacing it with a copy of the original meeting.
4. Check that the replacement copy has been successfully added to the schedule and that everything appears correct.
5. Close the meetings page once you have verified the update.
