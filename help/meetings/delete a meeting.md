# Deleting Committee Meetings

## Overview

This guide explains how to remove meetings from your committee's schedule when they're no longer needed.
## When to Delete a Meeting

You might need to delete a meeting when:
- The meeting is no longer necessary
- Plans have changed and the meeting won't occur
- You created a duplicate meeting by mistake
- The meeting was scheduled incorrectly
- Business requirements have shifted

## Important Considerations Before Deleting

**Check for Dependencies** - Ensure the meeting isn't linked to other important documents or decisions

**Notify Participants** - Consider informing attendees before deleting, especially if invitations were already sent

**Save Important Information** - Download or copy any meeting materials, notes, or documents you want to keep

**Verify Permissions** - Make sure you have the authority to delete the meeting

## How to Delete a Meeting

### Accessing Your Meetings
Navigate to your committee's meetings page where you can see all scheduled meetings. This page displays your meetings in chronological order or by type, depending on your system settings.

### Selecting the Meeting to Delete
Browse through your meeting list to find the specific meeting you want to remove. Meetings are typically identified by:
- Meeting title or name
- Meeting date and time
- Meeting type (General, Special, Annual)

Click on the meeting you want to delete to select it. Make sure you've chosen the correct meeting before proceeding.

### Initiating the Deletion
1. Look for the "Delete" in the toolbar or context menu

2. Click on the delete option.

### Confirming the Deletion
1. The system will ask you to confirm your deletion choice. This safety step prevents accidental removals. Review the meeting details one final time and confirm that you want to proceed. This page also allows for a new meeting to take its place if desired.
2. Once the details have been confirmed click "Confirm Delete"

## After Deletion

Once you've successfully deleted a meeting:
- Verify it no longer appears in your meetings list
- Send manual notifications to participants if needed
- Update any related calendars or scheduling systems
- Reschedule if the meeting needs to occur at a different time

## Recovery and Troubleshooting

**Can't Delete a Meeting:**
- Check that you have the necessary permissions
- Verify the meeting hasn't already started
- Ensure you're not trying to delete a recurring meeting series

**Accidental Deletion:**
- Contact support and they should be able to restore the meeting
