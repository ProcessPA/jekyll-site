# How to Edit the Location of a Selected Meeting

## Overview
In this guide, we'll walk you through the simple steps to change the location of a meeting for your committee. Whether you need to update the venue or simply change addresses, this process will help you make the necessary adjustments easily.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Committee's Meetings Page**
   - Begin by accessing the meetings page for the specific committee you are managing. This can usually be done through your organization's meeting management system.

2. **Select the Meeting**
   - Locate the meeting you wish to edit. This usually involves finding the meeting in the list of scheduled meetings.

3. **Change the Meeting Location**
   - Once you've selected the meeting, look for an option to edit or change the meeting details. Here, you will find a section to update the location. Replace the current location with your new locationâ€”let's say you want to set it to `Revised Location`.

4. **Confirm the Changes**
   - After entering the new location, make sure to save or confirm the changes. It is important to ensure that the new location is now reflected in the meeting details.

5. **Close the Meetings Page**
   - Finally, once all changes are saved and you've confirmed that everything is in order, you can close the meetings page. 

By following these steps, you can efficiently update the meeting location to stay organized and keep all participants informed.
