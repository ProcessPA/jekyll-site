# How to Edit Scheduled Meeting Dates

## Overview
In this guide, you will learn how to edit the scheduled start and end dates of a meeting within the `Meetings` application. This process is essential for keeping your meetings organized and ensuring everyone is aware of the updated schedule.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Editing the Scheduled Start Date

1. **Open the Meetings Page**  
   Access the meetings page for the relevant committee by using its unique identifier.

2. **Set the Scheduled Start Date**  
   Choose the date and time for your meeting. For example, you may want to set it for January 1, 2050, at 9:00 AM. Use the scheduling feature to update this date.

3. **Verify the Scheduled Date**  
   While you cannot visually confirm the change, check that the meeting's scheduled date has been updated to reflect January 1, 2050, at 9:00 AM using the correct format.

4. **Close the Meetings Page**  
   Once you're done, make sure to close the meetings page to save your changes and exit the application.

### Editing the Scheduled End Date

1. **Open the Meetings Page**  
   Again, begin by accessing the meetings page for the appropriate committee.

2. **Set the Scheduled End Date**  
   Decide on the end date and time for your meeting. As an example, you might set the end time for January 1, 2050, at 11:00 AM. Use the scheduling tool to enter this information.

3. **Note on Validation**  
   Currently, you will not be able to visually confirm that the end date has been assigned, as the meeting cards do not display end dates or durations at this time.

4. **Close the Meetings Page**  
   After updating the end date, close the meetings page to ensure your changes are saved.

With these steps, you can effectively manage the scheduling of your meetings to fit your business needs.
