## Overview

This guide provides easy-to-follow instructions on how to edit the scheduled date and end date of a selected meeting in an online meeting management system. You will learn how to open the meeting page, set new dates for your meetings, and close the meetings page when you are finished.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Edit The Scheduled Date Of The Selected Meeting

1. **Open The Meetings Page**
   - Navigate to the meetings page specific to your active committee by using the committee ID.

2. **Set The New Scheduled Date**
   - Choose a new date and time for the meeting. For this example, we're setting it to `January 1, 2050` at `9:00 AM`.
   - Use the meeting identifier `0` to indicate which meeting you are updating.

3. **Confirm The Date Change**
   - Ensure that the scheduled date has been updated to reflect your new choice. The date should display in a readable format.

4. **Close The Meetings Page**
   - After confirming the date change, close the meetings page to finalize your actions.

### Edit The Scheduled End Date Of The Selected Meeting

1. **Open The Meetings Page Again**
   - Return to the meetings page for your active committee using the committee ID.

2. **Set The New Scheduled End Date**
   - Select a new end date and time for the meeting. For this example, we're updating it to `January 1, 2050` at `11:00 AM`.
   - Again, use the meeting identifier `0` for the specific meeting.

3. **Note On Validation**
   - Currently, there is no way to verify that the end date has been successfully changed, as the meeting details may not display this information.

4. **Close The Meetings Page**
   - Once you have made the changes, close the meetings page to ensure all modifications are saved.
