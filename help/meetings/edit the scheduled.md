### Overview

This document provides simple instructions on how to edit the scheduled date and end date of a selected meeting in your meeting management system. Following these steps will allow you to keep your schedule organized and ensure that all attendees are informed of any changes.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Editing The Scheduled Date Of The Selected Meeting

1. **Open The Meetings Page**
   - Navigate to the meetings page for your active committee. Use the `activeCommitteeId` to find your specific committee.

   - Choose the new date and time for the meeting. For example, set it to `2050-01-01 09:00`.

3. **Confirm The Change**
   - Verify that the scheduled date has been updated correctly. The new date should match the one you set.

3. **Validate The Change (if applicable)**
   - Note that currently, you cannot check the assigned value for the end time since meeting cards do not display meeting end dates or durations.
