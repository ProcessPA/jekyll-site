# How to Edit the Title of a Meeting

## Overview
In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to edit the title of a selected meeting in your calendar system. This is particularly helpful when you need to update the title for clarity or to reflect changes in the meeting's focus. 

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Meetings Page**  
   Begin by navigating to the meetings page associated with your committee. You can do this by accessing the relevant link or application using your committee's ID.

   

2. **Select the Meeting**  
   Once you are on the meetings page, find the specific meeting you want to edit. You can identify the meeting by its current title or the details associated with it.

   

3. **Edit the Meeting Title**  
   Click on the option to rename the meeting. In the prompt that appears, enter the new title you wish to assign. For instance, you might change it from "Initial Discussion" to "Renamed Meeting". 

   

4. **Save Your Changes**  
   After entering the new title, look for the save button or confirmation prompt to ensure your changes are applied. This step is crucial to avoid losing any edits you've made.

   

5. **Verify the Update**  
   Take a moment to confirm that the meeting title has been successfully updated. You should see the new title reflected in the meeting list or details.

   

6. **Close the Meetings Page**  
   Once you have finished editing and confirming the changes, you can safely close the meetings page.

   

By following these steps, you can easily update the title of any meeting as needed.
