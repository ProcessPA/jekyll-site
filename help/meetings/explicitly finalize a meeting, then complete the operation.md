# Finalizing a Meeting: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview
Finalizing a meeting is an important step to ensure that all proceedings are officially completed and documented. This guide will walk you through the simple steps needed to explicitly finalize a meeting in your conference management system, ensuring everything is properly noted for later reference.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Meeting**
   - Access the meeting you want to finalize. You will need to navigate to the specific meeting using its unique identifier. For example, you may enter `active-meeting-123` in your system to locate it.

   

2. **Wait for the Meeting to Close**
   - Allow the system some time to confirm that the meeting is officially closed. You may see the status changing on your screen to indicate that the meeting has ended.

   

3. **Finalize the Meeting**
   - Proceed to finalize the meeting. There should be a button or option labeled "Finalize Meeting" in your meeting interface. Clicking this will mark the meeting as officially concluded.

   

4. **Confirm Finalization**
   - Check to see if the system indicates that the meeting has been successfully finalized. You should receive a confirmation message or notification stating that the process was successful.

   

5. **Verify Meeting State**
   - Lastly, ensure that the meeting state reflects that it has been finalized. This check will confirm that all details have been properly recorded. The state should now indicate "Finalized."

   

6. **Close the Meeting Page**
   - Once everything has been finalized and verified, you can close the meeting page. This will help you return to your main dashboard or continue with other tasks.

   

By following these steps, you will successfully finalize your meeting and ensure that all details are appropriately documented for future reference.
