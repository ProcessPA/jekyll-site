## Overview

This guide shows you how to find and open a specific meeting in your meetings management system. You'll learn to navigate from your main meetings page to the individual meeting details where you can manage and participate in your meeting.

## Finding Your Meeting

### Identifying Your Meeting
Once you're viewing the committee's meetings, you'll see a list of scheduled meetings. Meetings may be displayed with:
- Meeting titles or names
- Meeting dates and times  
- Current status (upcoming, in progress, completed)

Find the specific meeting you need to access. If you're looking for the first meeting in the list, it will typically appear at the top or be marked with an ID like "0" or "1".

## Opening the Meeting

### Selecting the Meeting
Click on the meeting entry you want to open. This could be:
- The meeting title or name
- An "Open" or "View" button next to the meeting
- The entire meeting row if it's clickable

### Waiting for the Meeting to Load
After clicking on your meeting, the system will load the meeting page. This page contains all the details and controls for that specific meeting. Wait for the page to fully load before taking any actions.

You'll know the page has loaded completely when you can see:
- Meeting title and description
- Meeting date, time, and duration
- Participant list or attendee information
- Meeting controls (start, join, edit, etc.)
- Any meeting materials or agenda items

### Confirming You're in the Right Place
Double-check that the meeting information displayed matches what you expected:
- Meeting title should match what you were looking for
- Date and time should be correct

## What You Can Do Next
Once your meeting page is open, you can:
- Start the meeting if you're the organizer
- View or edit meeting details
- Access meeting materials and documents

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Meeting won't load**: Try refreshing your browser or checking your internet connection

**Can't find your meeting**: Verify you're looking in the correct committee or check if the meeting date has changed
