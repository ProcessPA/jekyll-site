## Overview
This guide will help you pause a meeting efficiently. Pausing a meeting temporarily halts all ongoing activities, allowing participants to take a break or address any urgent matters without ending the session.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open The Meeting
1. Locate and select the active meeting you wish to pause. 
   - Ensure you have the meeting ID handy (for example, `2023-10-01-Annual-Review`).
   
### 2. Wait For The Meeting To Start
1. Monitor the meeting status. 
   - Confirm that the meeting is in the "Started" state before proceeding to pause.

### 3. Pause The Meeting
1. Initiate the pause function for the meeting. 
   - This can typically be found in the meeting controls menu.

### 4. Verify The Meeting State
1. Check the status of the meeting.
   - Ensure that the meeting now shows as "Paused" to confirm the action was successful.

### 5. Close The Meeting
1. Conclude your session by closing the meeting interface.
   - Make sure to properly exit to avoid confusion for other participants.
