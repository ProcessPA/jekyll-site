## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to re-open a closed meeting in your meeting management system. Follow these simple steps to ensure your meeting is properly re-opened and ready for attendees.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open The Meeting
1. Navigate to the meeting page in your meeting management system.
2. Access the meeting by using its unique identifier. For example, if your meeting ID is `12345`, you would enter it to open this specific meeting.

### Step 2: Wait For The Meeting To Be Closed
1. Allow the system to verify that the meeting status is currently “Closed.” This step ensures you are re-opening the correct meeting.

### Step 3: Re-Open The Meeting
1. Once the meeting is confirmed to be closed, look for the option to re-open the meeting.
2. Click on the “Re-Open Meeting” button to initiate the process.

### Step 4: Check The Meeting State
1. After re-opening, verify the new state of the meeting.
2. The meeting should now display a status of “Paused,” indicating it is re-opened successfully.

### Step 5: Close The Meeting Again
1. If necessary, quickly close the meeting once more by selecting the appropriate option.
2. Confirm that the system registers this action correctly. 

### Re-Open The Meeting For The Second Time
Follow the same steps as above to re-open the meeting again if needed, ensuring you use the correct identifier and check the status after re-opening.
