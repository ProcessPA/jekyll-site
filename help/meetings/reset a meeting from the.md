# Guide to Resetting a Meeting

## Overview
This document provides simple instructions on how to reset a meeting in different states. Whether your meeting is currently in a "Started" or "Paused" state, you can easily revert it to its initial "Unstarted" condition. This is particularly useful for organizations that need to manage their meeting schedules effectively.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Resetting a Meeting from the Started State

1. Open the meeting by accessing the active meeting ID. For example, you might find it under `Active_Meeting_ID_123`.
   
2. Wait until the meeting is confirmed to be in the "Started" state.

3. Use the reset function to revert the meeting to its original status.

4. Verify that the meeting state is now "Unstarted".

5. Once complete, close the meeting session.

### Resetting a Meeting from the Paused State

1. Start by opening the meeting using the active meeting ID like `Active_Meeting_ID_123`.

2. Ensure that you are in the "Started" state before proceeding.

3. Pause the meeting to shift it to the "Paused" state.

4. Wait until the meeting confirms that it is now in the "Paused" state.

5. Use the reset function to revert the meeting to its initial status.

6. Verify that the meeting state is now "Unstarted".

7. Finally, close the meeting session.

By following these steps, you can effectively reset a meeting, whether it's currently running or paused, ensuring your business meetings are organized and manageable.
