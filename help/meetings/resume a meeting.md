# How to Resume a Meeting

## Overview
Resuming a meeting that has been paused is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to successfully bring your meeting back to the active state, ensuring that your discussions can continue without interruptions.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Meeting**  
   Begin by accessing the meeting page. You will need to locate your specific meeting by using its unique identifier. For example, you might open a meeting titled `Weekly Sales Review`.

2. **Check Meeting Status**  
   Wait until you confirm that the meeting is paused. This means no discussions or activities are currently taking place. For instance, a meeting may be in a paused state during a break.

3. **Resume the Meeting**  
   Once you have verified that the meeting is paused, proceed to resume it. This action will reactivate the meeting, allowing all participants to continue their discussions actively.

4. **Verify the Meeting State**  
   Make sure to check that the meeting state has changed from "Paused" to "Started". This confirms that everyone is back on track and can continue with the agenda.

5. **Close the Meeting Page**  
   After facilitating the resumption of the meeting, you can close the meeting page. This is the final step to end your interaction with the meeting session until you need to refer back to it later.

By following these steps, you can easily manage the flow of your meetings and ensure that your business discussions are always on point.
