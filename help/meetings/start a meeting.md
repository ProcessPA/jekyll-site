# How to Start a Meeting

## Overview
Starting a meeting is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to initiate a meeting, whether it’s your first time or you've done it before. By following these steps, you'll ensure your meeting is ready to go when you are.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Meeting**
   - Access your meeting by referring to the unique identifier you have for it. For example, if your meeting is about the `Annual Budget Planning`, locate the relevant meeting ID.

2. **Check the Meeting Status**
   - Wait until the system indicates the meeting has not yet started. This state is important to ensure you are beginning the meeting at the right time.

3. **Start the Meeting**
   - Click on the appropriate option to start the meeting. For instance, if you’re initiating the `Quarterly Sales Review`, look for the "Start Meeting" button and select it.

4. **Confirm the Meeting is Started**
   - After starting, double-check that the meeting status has now changed to indicate that it is currently ongoing. This confirmation is key to ensure that everyone can join.

5. **Close the Meeting**
   - Once the meeting is concluded, make sure to close the meeting interface properly to avoid any confusion for the attendees. You can find the "Close Meeting" option typically towards the end of the meeting process.

Follow these steps to successfully start your `Team Collaboration Session` or any other meetings you have scheduled!
