## Overview

This guide walks you through launching meetings using your meeting management system. You'll learn how to check meeting readiness, start meetings properly, and verify they're running successfully.

## Understanding Meeting States

Before starting any meeting, it's helpful to understand the different states your meeting can be in:

- **Scheduled** - Meeting is scheduled but hasn't begun yet
- **Started** - Meeting is currently active and participants can join
- **Paused** - Meeting is currently paused (the timer stops)
- **Finalised** - Meeting has concluded and is no longer accessible

## How to Start a Meeting

### Accessing Your Meeting
Find your meeting by selecting it from your scheduled meetings list. This will take you to the meeting management page where you can see all the meeting details and controls.

### Checking Meeting Readiness
Before you can start a meeting, make sure it shows as "Scheduled" in the meeting status area.

### Launching the Meeting
Once you've confirmed the meeting is ready to start, look for the "Start" button in the toolbar and click it. Then the meeting will be ready to commence.
