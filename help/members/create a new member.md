## Overview

This guide explains how to add different types of members to your committee. You can create members with various access levels and assign specific leadership roles as needed.

## Member Types and Access Levels

**Admin Members** - Full access to manage all committee functions and settings
**Normal Members** - Standard access to participate in committee activities  
**Email-Only Members** - Receive notifications but cannot access committee materials
**No-Access Members** - Listed as members but have no system access

**Leadership Roles** - Normal members can also be assigned positions like President, Vice President, Treasurer, or Secretary

## How to Add Members

### Getting Started
1. Navigate to the members section of your committee
2. Look for the "Add Member" or "Create Member" button

### Adding Basic Members
When creating a new member, you'll select their access level:

- Choose **Admin** for members who need full management capabilities
- Choose **Normal** for standard participating members
- Choose **Email-Only** for members who only need to receive updates
- Choose **No-Access** for honorary or inactive members who should remain listed

### Assigning Leadership Roles
For Normal members who will serve in leadership positions:

1. Create the member as a Normal member first
2. Select their specific role from the available options:
   - **President** - Committee leader and primary decision maker
   - **Vice President** - Secondary leader and President's deputy  
   - **Treasurer** - Financial oversight and budget management
   - **Secretary** - Meeting notes and administrative coordination

### Confirming Your Changes
After creating each member, verify that their role appears correctly in the member list before moving on to add additional members.

## Tips for Success
- Plan your committee structure before adding members to avoid confusion
- Consider starting with leadership roles first, then adding other members
- Double-check member access levels match their intended responsibilities
- Remember that member roles can be changed later if needed
