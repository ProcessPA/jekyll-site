Occassionally we come across the need to have two members added and both share an email address. This common occurs when a husbanda & wife just share one email account.

Since Process PA uses the email address as the unique identifier this causes a small issues.

Fortunately there is a work-around that will often suffice.

Outlook.com (Hotmail, live.com) and Gmail support a little known feature of + (plus) email aliasing.

What this allows is emails to be addressed to multiple addresses, but come into the same inbox, without any configuration.

Simplying if your email is smiths@outlook.com, you could use smiths+john@outlook.com or smiths+jane@outlook.com and they would come to the same email.

See more details [here](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html){: target="_blank"} and [here](https://www.ghacks.net/2013/09/17/can-now-use-email-aliases-outlook-com/){: target="_blank"}.

This is typically used to aid filtering emails.

In Process PA however, simply add one user with the main email address, and the other with + alaising. They will both receive an email addressed to them if their email provider supports plus aliasing and can both log in and register attendance independently.
