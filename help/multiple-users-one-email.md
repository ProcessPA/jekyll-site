Occassionally we come across the need to have two members added and both share an email address. This common occurs when a couple just share one email account, or we are using a shared inbox like secretary@veryrealemail.com.

Since Process PA uses the email address as the unique identifier this can cause a small issues.

Fortunately there is a work-around that will often suffice.

Outlook.com (Hotmail, live.com), Office 365 (Exchange), and Gmail support a little known feature of plus aliasing.

Plus addressing is a feature of email addresses that allows you to add a "+" symbol and any combination of text after your email address' username, before the "@" symbol. For example, if your email address is "example@gmail.com", you could use "example+test@gmail.com" or "example+work@gmail.com" as separate email addresses.

This feature can be useful for creating multiple email addresses that all go to the same inbox, but can be used for different purposes or as different users with Process PA.

Here's an example of how you can use plus addressing to create unique email addresses for multiple users:

Let's say you have a team of five people who need to create accounts for Process PA. You want to use a shared inbox, so that all you don't need to setup explicit inboxes for each team member. Here's an example of how you could set up email addresses for each team member:

 - Team member 1: team+member1@example.com
 - Team member 2: team+member2@example.com
 - Team member 3: team+member3@example.com
 - Team member 4: team+member4@example.com
 - Team member 5: team+member5@example.com

All of the above email addresses will be delivered to the same inbox as "team@example.com" , but you can use the plus addressing to add multiple unique member accounts in Process PA with only one email inbox. That allows each member to have independent logins and their name in the minutes.
