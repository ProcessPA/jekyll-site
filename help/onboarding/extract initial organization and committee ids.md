# Extract Initial Organization and Committee IDs

## Overview
This guide explains how to retrieve the initial organization ID and the primary committee ID from your home page. This process is essential for ensuring that you are working with the correct organizational and committee information in your business workflows.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open the Home Page**: Begin by navigating to your home page. This is the main dashboard where you can access important organizational data.
