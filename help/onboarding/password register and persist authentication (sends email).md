# Password Registration and Email Confirmation

## Overview
This guide explains the process to register a new user, ensuring that their information is saved securely and that they receive a confirmation email. This procedure includes entering personal details, creating a password, and completing the registration on a web application.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clear Cookies**  
   Begin by clearing any existing cookies from your browser. This is important to ensure that you start anew without any stored session data.

2. **Open the Registration Page**  
   Go to the registration page of the application where you want to sign up.

3. **Enter Personal Information**  
   - Fill in your `First Name` in the designated field.
   - Fill in your `Last Name` in the designated field.
   - Enter your `Email Address`, which will be used for account verification.
   - Create a new `Password` and enter it in the appropriate field.
   - Confirm your `Password` by re-entering it in the confirmation field.

4. **Submit the Registration Form**  
   After filling out all required fields, click on the submit button to send your registration information.

5. **Wait for the Home Page to Load**  
   After submission, the application will redirect you to the home page. Wait until the home page is fully displayed, indicating that your registration was successful.

6. **Save Your Session**  
   If your application saves user sessions, ensure that your session is saved to maintain your logged-in status.

7. **Close the Application**  
   Once everything is complete, you can close the application or continue to use it as needed.

Remember to check your email for the confirmation message to verify your account and complete the registration process.
