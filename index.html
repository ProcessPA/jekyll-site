testimonies:
  - testimonial: "It is a massive time saver and simplifies everything. There is never any questions about what was said as minutes are recorded on the night, on a screen for all to see and with all reports available. It is brilliant."
    cite: "Carol Ramsay – Elanora State High School"
  - testimonial: "I’ve been in the club for over 13 years and it is a lot of work. With Process PA we are saving hours of tedious paperwork and everything is in the one place. Minutes are done quickly and easily, Action Items are assigned and emailed out and in the agenda to follow up in the next meeting. I wish this was available years ago."
    cite: "Kim Miles – Capalaba Football Club Inc"
  - testimonial: "We always are needing to change to stay relevant. With the change in the way people expecting technology to make things easier, Process PA provides a modern platform for getting meetings and minutes done. It really is fantastic. Many thanks to Process PA for this timesaver!"
    cite: "Wendy Dunstan – Co-Director, Wynnum General Gordon Kindergarten"
  - testimonial: "Process PA is not comparable to something like Dropbox or SharePoint. I am always looking at how I can make the job easier to be less intimidating for new members. Instead of carrying stacks of paper to the meetings, everything has already been distributed and is all contained online and easily accessible for all."
    cite: "Renee Walls – Mango Hill State School"
  - testimonial: "See, minutes are important and because of you (Process PA), our jobs, and all other secretaries/treasurers jobs (voluntary as the positions are) are going to be made so much easier for all of us to have it all done on the day/night of the meeting with the introduction of your programme. If 'non-techies' like us can use it, anyone can!"
