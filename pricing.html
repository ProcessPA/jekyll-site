<h4>FAQ</h4>




<h5>Do I really need software to do this for me?</h5>


In the 90s many organizations did their accounting with paper or Excel. Large corporations however, used expensive software systems that did the job quicker, more accurate and less error prone. With the increasing accessibility of software that transition continued down to most organizations and now it is difficult to find even the smallest of organization not using accounting software. Governance software is in a similar transition. Large corporation have been using expensive board portals and document management system with great benefit. With the wide spread adoption of cloud software gaining more traction, the accessibility of software is reaching more organizations and provides a great user experience helping attract volunteers and free time to focus on the outcomes of your organization.

Getting volunteers to commit their time regularly is difficult now. With Process PA even irregular contributions results in consistent governance and administration for your organization.


<h5>Currently administration is done manually and has not cost us anything, why start paying now?</h5>


You are actually paying for it now, however the costs are hidden. The biggest cost is often time. This is usually volunteer time, but that is still costly, arguably more so. Volunteers are the life of so many associations and without providing proper tooling support many quickly burn out and your organization suffers. How many organization work hard to find someone to fulfil the secretary duties only to have them leave due to the work load. By providing automation and tooling the workload is significantly reduced and allows volunteer time to be spent where they feel they contribute more valuably and doing something they would prefer to do to add value to the organization.

We could go into the cost of the equivalent minimum wage time (if currently done by volunteers), printing and distribution costs, office bearer churn and training costs, opportunity cost and more. The value of a platform to make the committee administration more enjoyable and information accessible for all involved has high returns for a small investment.


<h5>We really like it and would love to use it, but we really don't have the funds.</h5>


With most associations funds are tight. I understand. We are continually trying to reduce the cost so we can make it more accessible to organizations of all sizes. We want to support you and your organization.
