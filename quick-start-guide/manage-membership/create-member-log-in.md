Members of your organization can register an account and gain access to meeting schedules, files and other information. If you want to create a new log in account for a member, just do the following steps: 

1. At the “Members” page, which you can access by clicking the “Members” tab located at the top portion of the screen”, you will see the list of meeting members and their designations. In this guide, we will create an account for “Jacob Smith” as highlighted in red box below. To start off, exit from your current account by clicking on the “Log off” button.

7. When you click on the “Member” tab located at the top portion of the page, you will be able to view the members of the organization and the new registered user. 

**Quick Note:** The new user will not have access to change anything in the page since their account is set to a regular one compared to that of an administrator.
