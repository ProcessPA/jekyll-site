  3. You can manage the access level of each member by clicking the second button at the right portion of the page. You may choose to either give them an admin access, where they can run meetings and change settings in the system, or give them a normal access, where they can view meetings and content but cannot edit them.

A dialog will appear where you can supply the new member’s name and email address. Once you’re done, click on the “ADD MEMBER” button at the lower right end portion of the pop up page.
