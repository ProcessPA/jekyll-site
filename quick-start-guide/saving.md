A tick indicates all is saved.

If at anytime the save fails to reach the server. The message below will show warning you. You then have the opportunity to copy changes and then refresh and paste them back in. However, in practice it is usually a word or two that has been missed from an intermittent Internet connectivity failure and hitting Refresh will get you back on track.
