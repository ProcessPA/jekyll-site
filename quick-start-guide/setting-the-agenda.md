Creating Sub-Agenda Items

When Sub Agenda Items are required, the “Notes” section can be utilized. Or alternatively, try playing around with the Agenda Item names. There are many ways to achieve this, here are three examples:

Example 1: The notes section can be used, using bullets and numbering:

Example 2: Headings could be made using capitals in each Agenda Item, followed by the Sub Agenda Item:
<img class="img-fluid" src="/content/pages/help/subagenda1.png" />
Example 3: The use of brackets can describe the Sub Agenda Item that is being discussed:
