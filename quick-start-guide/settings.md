  2. Emails that are sent from Process PA for notifications such as meeting times, agendas, minutes and actions are sent from notifications@processpa.com.click on the "Select Member" section under the “Email Reply-to Address” title. NOTE: These emails will come from an email service, that masks the address as the member that has been selected.
