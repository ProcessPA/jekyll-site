We were about to spend more money on advertising Process PA when we stopped to ask; how can we **reward our customers** and grow our business at the same time?

Simple.......refer someone you know would benefit from Process PA and 3 great things happen.

1. ​You personally **receive $50 cash**
2. Your organisation **receives 1 month free** access to Process PA
3. Your referred organization **receives 1 month free** access to Process PA

# How it works​
* ​Add your details and whom you wish to refer.
* We will send them a welcome email and take it from there.

Once they sign up to a paid account, we will immediately **pay you $50** via Paypal and extend your next scheduled payment by 1 month.

# FAQ

* **Do I get $50 for each person I refer?** Yes, you will receive as many $50 as you refer and that sign up to a paid subscription of Process PA.
* **Can more than one person on our committee refer someone?** Absolutely, as many people and referrals as you like, each successful sign up will credit your organisation plus see $50 cash paid to anyone who has referred someone to Process PA who signs up.
* **What if we refer more than 1 person who sign up?** You get more months free. Refer 12 and you get a full year free, more if you can refer more than 12, there is no limit!
* **Does the person I refer need to sign up for a year or just pay by the month?** As long as they sign up for 1 month, you receive $50 for each referral who signs up.
* **What if I do not want to receive $50 cash?** ​We understand some people may not wish to receive money for simply referring so either we will donate this to your charity of choice, (including your organisation if charitable) or we will simply credit your subscription account for a further $50.
