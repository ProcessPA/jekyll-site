Feedback we get from our customers is great, and we have many customers sharing with others the success they have had using Process PA.

To reward our customers and their friends we will provide:

1. Your organisation receives **10% off annual renewal** access to Process PA
2. Your referred organisation receives **10% off annual subscription** to Process PA

Referral's will stack. **Refer 10 organisations** over the year, and your **renewal will be free**.

# How it worksâ€‹

Use the discount code found in your account (Coming soon) and give it to any organisation you think would benefit from Process PA.

When that organization applies the code, the discount will be applied for their subscription. After their purchase 10% discount will be applied on your subscription for your next renewal. If you pay monthly, you'll get the next month free.

# FAQ

* **Can more than one person on our committee refer someone?** Absolutely, as many people and referrals as you like, each successful sign up will credit your organisation.
* **What if we refer more than 1 organisations who sign up?** You get more more discount! Refer 10 and you get a full year free. If you do more than 10, we'll discount the next years.
* **Does the person I refer need to sign up for a year or just pay by the month?** As long as they sign up for 1 month, you receive the 10% discount. They however only have the 10% off the annual plan.
* **Any other questions?** Please [contact support](mailto:support@processpa.com?subject=Referral Program) if you have any other questions.
